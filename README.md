The traffic originating from cloud data center racks usually follow a heavy-tailed distribution. Flow scheduling schemes as well as AQM policies such as DCTCP, L2DCT, pFabric and Codel, RED,  have been proposed which cater to heavy tailed distributions of network traffic and provide minimum flow completion times for short/long flows. Facebook released a dataset which describes light tailed workload characteristics inside itâ€™s cloud data center. There are currently no effective flow scheduling schemes which provide low AFCTs(Average Flow Completion Times) as network traffic switches between heavy to light tailed distributions and vice versa. We carried out measurements by leveraging computer-generated transport protocols, RemyCCs, to determine how well they fare against datacenter workloads and topology.
